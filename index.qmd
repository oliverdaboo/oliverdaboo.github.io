Welcome to 412 Daboo! I am a Junior on the Soccer team at Colby College majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. 
I have a huge interest in sports, with my favorites being Soccer, Baseball, Formula 1, Hockey, and Tennis. I am also extremely passionate about the sports teams in my hometown of Pittsburgh.
